          <h2>Biography</h2>

          <h3>Early Life</h3>
          <p>
            Born in 1815 in London, Ada Lovelace was the daughter of poet Lord
            Byron and mathematician Anne Isabella Milbanke. Encouraged by her
            mother to pursue mathematics and logic, Ada showed an early
            fascination with numbers and mechanical inventions, which later
            shaped her visionary ideas about computation.
          </p>

          <h3>Scientific Work</h3>
          <p>
            Lovelace collaborated with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine,
            translating an article about the machine and adding extensive notes
            that contained what is recognized as the first computer algorithm.
            She uniquely foresaw that machines could go beyond arithmetic,
            suggesting they might one day compose music or create art.
          </p>

          <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p>
            Though her ideas were not implemented during her lifetime, Ada
            Lovelace is now celebrated as the world’s first computer programmer.
            Her insight into the potential of computing laid the intellectual
            foundation for modern computer science.
